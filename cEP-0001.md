Abstract
--------

This cEP describes the official roles members of the coala community can hold
and how they can vote on different levels of decisions.


Roles
-----

The following roles can be held by members of the coala community:

### Newcomer

A newcomer is someone that was just introduced to the coala project and
community and begins to contribute to it. This rank mainly represents the
learning phase of the contribution process.

Every org member that started following the [newcomer guide](//coala.io/newcomer)
is declared a newcomer by invitation into the GitHub organisation. Newcomers can
work on issues with an assignment.

### Developer

A developer is someone that showed capable of contributing to coala. They are
involved on a normal level and help with contributions and reviews on a
semi-regular basis.

When a newcomer finished the newcomer guide they can ask a maintainer to be
promoted to a developer. A developer has all the rights of a newcomer but can be an
official coala team member and can use cobot to label issues and pull requests.
Developers also have voting rights on A level decisions.

If the contributions of a developer show the lack of fundamental understanding
of the coala workflow they can be demoted to the newcomer rank with a B level
decision. The promotion to developer must be granted after a renewed completion
of the newcomer guide.
A developer can choose to be demoted newcomer at any time.

### Maintainer

A Maintainer is someone that showed persistence in contributions and or an
increased quality compared to a developer. They offer experience and passion for
the project and are granted full voting rights due to their achievements.

A developer can be promoted to a maintainer with a B level decision. This decision
does not have to be initiated by a maintainer so it is valid for a developer to
propose himself for a promotion.
A maintainer has all the rights a developer has. Additionally maintainers have
write access to coala repositories, can promote newcomers and developers and
have voting rights on B and C level decisions.

The two important aspects of the maintainer rank are the voting rights for B and
C level decisions and the write access. While the write access mostly is a
convenience feature that is granted to long time contributors as a quality of
life improvement and sign of trust, the voting rights also show the valuation
of ones knowledge and opinions.
It is due to these considerations, that it is valid to promote contributors to
maintainers that did not finish the newcomer guide. This enables non coding
contributors to add their input to important decisions.

The demotion from maintainer to developer represents a C level decision. It
should only be done if a maintainer has shown inactivity for prolonged periods
of time, half a year and upwards.
__This should not be used as a tool to silence unwanted opinions!__
Maintainers may choose to be demoted to developers at any time.


### Benevolent Limited Dictator (BLD)

Members of the coala community have suggested the establishment of a Benevolent
Limited Dictator (short: BLD) similar to the Python community's Guido.

The BLD has the same rights as a maintainer with additional veto rights as
described below. As per this cEP, Lasse Schuirmann is the BLD for coala.

The BLD can not be demoted at any point but may decide to resign and be demoted
to a maintainer any time.

### Removal from the coala community

The removal of any member from the coala community represents a C level
decision. This includes loss of all ranks and rights in the community and
declares that person unwanted as a member of the coala community.

This status stays active indefinitely but can be revoked at any point by a C
level decision.


Decision Types
--------------

### A Level Decision

An **A Level Decision** may be carried out by any member of the coala
community, for example a code review. If there is a disagreement between two
members, they may resolve this in a discussion or determine a B level decision
instead.

### B Level Decision

A **B Level Decision** may be carried out by two or more members of the coala
community. The decision in favour or against the proposal may be determined if
two more members are for it than against it (or against it than for it
respectively).

If no agreement is possible, a C level decision can be made. The BLD may raise
the decision to a C level decision at will.

### C Level Decision

For a C level decision, a vote must be officially announced at the coala
members channel and via the coala-members mailing list. The vote must be up for
at least one week and is available to all members.

For a decision to happen, a simple majority of all participating members must
exist. If the same number of members is in favour as against the decision, the
BLD may decide. The BLD also may block a decision with reasons provided within
the week of voting. In this case no decision is made and discussions may
continue.
